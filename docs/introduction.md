## Introduction to Sigmie

Sigmie is a PHP library designed to simplify the process of creating **Searches** for your applications using Elasticsearch.

## Why Choose Sigmie?
Elasticsearch is a powerful tool that enables the creation of fast and relevant searches for your application. However, it can be complex and challenging to learn and use effectively. 

Sigmie is designed to alleviate this complexity, making Elasticsearch **easy** to use. It encapsulates years of experience in building **Searches** into simple, easy-to-use code abstractions. 

To better understand the benefits of Sigmie, let's consider a simple example.

## Basic Usage

Let's assume we have a `books` table in our database that we want to make searchable.

Consider an SQL table like this.

```php
|                                books                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| title                 | author                      | publication_year |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| "Moby Dick"           | "Herman Melville"           | 1851             |
| "War and Peace"       | "Leo Tolstoy"               | 1869             |
| "Pride and Prejudice" | "Jane Austen"               | 1813             |
```

```php
$sigmie->newSearch('books')
       ->properties($properties) // [tl! highlight]
       ->queryString('war')
       ->get()
       ->json();
```

There are four steps required
1. Define the `books` properties.
2. Create a Search **Index** that will contain the `books`.
3. Add the books to the **Index**.
4. Search for a **Query String**.

Here's a simple implementation of the above steps: 

```php

$book = new NewProperties;
$book->title();
$book->author();
$book->searchableNumber('publication_year');

$sigmie->newIndex(name:'books')->properties($book)->create();

$sigmie->collect(index:'books', refresh: true)->merge([
    new Document([
        'title' => 'Moby Dick',
        'author' => 'Herman Melville',
        'publication_year' => '1851'
    ]),
    new Document([
        'title' => 'War and Peace',
        'author' => 'Leo Tolstoy',
        'publication_year' => '1869'
    ]),
    new Document([
        'title' => 'Pride and Prejudice',
        'author' => 'Jane Austen',
        'publication_year' => '1813'
    ]),
]);

$sigmie->newSearch(index:'books')
    ->queryString('war')
    ->fields(['title'])
    ->retrieve(['title','author', 'publication_year'])
    ->get()
    ->json('hits');
```
The records that match our **Query String** are called **Hits** and can be found in the response array.

```php
[ // [tl! collapse:start]
    'total' => [ 
        'value' => 1,
        'relation' => 'eq',
    ],
    'max_score' => 0.9808291, // [tl! collapse:end]
    'hits' => [
        0 => [
            '_index' => 'books_20221118135236605861',
            '_type' => '_doc',
            '_id' => 'rYwDi4QBZcx7VxtuP11z',
            '_score' => 0.9808291,
            '_source' => [
                'title' => 'War and Peace', // [tl! focus]
                'author' => 'Leo Tolstoy' // [tl! focus]
                'publication_year' => '1869' // [tl! focus]
            ],
        ],
    ],
]; // [tl! collapse:start]
  // [tl! collapse:end]
```
