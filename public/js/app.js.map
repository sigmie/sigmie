Subscriber may accept or decline Beta Services. If accepted by Subscriber, Beta Services: (a) are provided only for evaluation purposes; (b) may not be relied on by Subscriber for production use; (c) may not be supported; and (d) may be subject to additional terms. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire on the date that a version of the Beta Services becomes generally available or is discontinued.

ALL BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. BETA SERVICES MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME.

ANY CONFIGURATIONS OR SUBSCRIBER DATA ENTERED INTO BETA SERVICES, AND ANY CUSTOMIZATIONS MADE TO BETA SERVICES BY OR FOR SUBSCRIBER, MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST IF THE BETA SERVICES ARE SUSPENDED, TERMINATED, OR DISCONTINUED.\n    <p>The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to cancel Your Order.</p>\n\n    <h3>Prices Policy</h3>\n    <p>The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.</p>\n\n    <h3>Payment</h3>\n    <p>Fees. Subscriber will pay all fees specified in Service Orders and provide accurate and updated billing contact information. Except as set forth in a Service Order, all fees payable under the Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars. Minimum commitments in Service Orders are (a) based on Services purchased and not actual usage; (b) non-cancelable; and (c) cannot be decreased during the specified term. Fees paid for minimum commitments are not refundable. Subscriber’s payments of fees are neither (x) contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor (y) dependent on statements not set forth in the Agreement or any Service Order.</p>\n\n    <p>Invoicing Terms. If the Service Order specifies that payment will occur by a method other than a credit card, Subscriber will provide a purchase order number in the applicable amount (or reasonable alternative proof of Subscriber’s ability to pay the fees specified in a Service Order), and promptly notify Us of any changes necessary for payment of an invoice. We will invoice Subscriber either monthly or according to the billing frequency stated in the Service Order. Invoices to be paid by credit card are due on the invoice date, all other invoices are due net 30 days from the invoice date. If any invoiced amount is not received by Us by the due date, then without limiting Our rights or remedies: (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower and (b) We may condition future subscription renewals and Service Orders on shorter payment terms. If Subscriber is paying for Services by credit card, Subscriber will provide Our authorized payment processer with valid credit card information and promptly notify Our authorized payment processor of any changes necessary to charge the credit card. The provision of credit card information to Our authorized payment processer authorizes Us, through its authorized payment processer, to charge the credit card for all Services specified in a Service Order, and any renewal subscription. Subscriber acknowledges that We will not have access to Subscriber’s credit card information.</p>\n    <p>Suspension of Service and Acceleration. If any amount owing by Subscriber is 30 or more days overdue (or 15 or more days overdue in the case of invoices to be paid by credit card), We may, without limiting any rights and remedies, accelerate Subscriber’s unpaid fee obligations to become immediately due and payable, and block the provision of Services to Subscriber until the overdue amounts are paid in full. We will give Subscriber at least 10 days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, before blocking Services to Subscriber.</p>\n    <p>Payment Disputes. We will not exercise any rights to block Services, accelerate payments, impose late charges or change payment terms with respect to an overdue amount for so long as Subscriber is disputing the overdue amount in good faith. The parties shall cooperate diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>\n    <p>Refund or Payment upon Termination. If Subscriber terminates the Agreement, we will refund any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders after the effective date of termination. If the Agreement is terminated by Us, the Subscriber will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Service Orders. In no event will termination relieve Subscriber of its obligation to pay any fees payable for the period prior to the effective date of termination. If Subscriber terminates without cause prior to the end of the then current term, Subscriber shall be immediately liable for the balance of the fees for the remainder of the term.</p>\n    <p>Taxes. Fees for Services do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Subscriber is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its Service Orders. If We are obligated by law to pay or collect Taxes for which Subscriber is responsible, we will invoice Subscriber and Subscriber will pay that amount unless Subscriber can provide a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Subscriber will provide Us any information We reasonably requests to determine whether We are obligated to collect Taxes. We are solely responsible for taxes assessable against its income, property, and employees.</p>\n\n    <h2>Promotions</h2>\n    <p>Any Promotions made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms.</p>\n    <p>If You participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy policy.
