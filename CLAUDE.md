### AI Team Assignments

| Task Category | Assigned Agent | Notes |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| **Elasticsearch Refactoring** | `elasticsearch-refactoring-expert` | Project-specific agent for fluent Elasticsearch syntax improvements |
| **Code Review** | `code-reviewer` | Mandatory for all PRs, security-aware reviews |
| **Performance Optimization** | `performance-optimizer` | Critical for search performance and Elasticsearch query optimization |
| **API Design** | `api-architect` | For designing new search APIs and query builders |
| **Backend Development** | `backend-developer` | General PHP development when no specialist agent available |
| **Documentation** | `documentation-specialist` | API docs, usage guides, integration examples |

### Specialized Use Cases

**For Elasticsearch-specific tasks:**
- Query builder improvements → `@elasticsearch-refactoring-expert`
- Search performance issues → `@performance-optimizer` 
- New search features → `@elasticsearch-refactoring-expert` + `@api-architect`

**For general development:**
- PHP code quality → `@code-reviewer`
- New APIs → `@api-architect`
- Performance bottlenecks → `@performance-optimizer`
- Documentation updates → `@documentation-specialist`

### Example Usage
Try: `@elasticsearch-refactoring-expert "I want to make this search query more expressive and readable"`
Try: `@performance-optimizer "This semantic search is too slow on large indices"`
Try: `@api-architect "Design a new faceted search API"`

## Project Overview

Sigmie provides a fluent, expressive interface for Elasticsearch operations with features including:

- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings and AI-powered search capabilities
- **Fluent Query Builder**: Laravel-inspired syntax for complex Elasticsearch queries  
- **Advanced Analysis**: Custom analyzers, token filters, and multilingual support
- **Index Management**: Aliased indices, mappings, and schema management
- **Aggregations & Facets**: Complex data aggregation with intuitive builders
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-performance search applications

The library emphasizes readability and maintainability while providing full access to Elasticsearch's powerful features.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use `$foo['bar'] ?? null` instead of `isset($foo['bar']) ? $foo['bar'] : null`
